# 🎄 Advent of Code 2025 – JavaScript Solutions

This repository contains solutions to **Advent of Code 2025**, implemented in **JavaScript (Node.js)**.

Each day’s solution is written as a standalone `.js` file and reads input from **standard input (stdin)**.

---

## 📦 Prerequisites

Make sure you have **Node.js** installed on your system.

```bash
node --version
```

If Node.js is not installed, download it from:
https://nodejs.org

▶️ How to Run a Solution

Copy the puzzle input for a specific day from the Advent of Code website.

Paste it into input.txt (replace any existing content).

Run the corresponding JavaScript file:

```bash
node dayX/file.js < dayX/input.txt
```
---

📝 Notes

Inputs are read using fs.readFileSync(0, "utf8"), so stdin redirection is required.

Each day’s solution is independent.

No external dependencies are used.
